# Overview

I wanted to understand the uses of Android Studio to make a functional App

The app as it is will digitally simulate the math behind rolling dice.

I wanted to create a better app for playing dnd remotly when you can't play face to face. So I started with understanding the die mechanics.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
